    desc:
        ui-name : |
            MSA Description
        short-hint : |
            Describe the contents of the output Gblocks MSA.
        placeholder: |
            Enter Description
    input_ref:
        ui-name : |
            Input MSA
        short-hint : |
            The MSA to trim.
    output_name:
        ui-name : |
            Output Gblocks MSA
        short-hint : |
            The name of the output Gblocks MSA.
    trim_level:
        ui-name : |
            Trim Level
        short-hint : |
            Specify the level of teimming to be used. 0=No gaps permitted; 1=Half occupancy; 2=Gaps ignored.
    min_seqs_for_conserved:
        ui-name : |
            Min Seqs for Conserved Pos
        short-hint : |
            The minimum number of sequences required with a conserved residue before a position (column) is considered a "Conserved Position". 0=Use MSA-derived default (e.g. for 14 seqs, default is 8).  Value must be &gt;= than N/2+1 and &lt;= Min Seqs For Flank Pos, where N=number of sequences.
    min_seqs_for_flank:
        ui-name : |
            Min Seqs for Flank Pos
        short-hint : |
            The minimum number of sequences required with a residue in a position (column) flanking a conserved position before being considered a "Flank Position". 0=Use MSA-derived default (e.g. for 14 seqs, default is 11).  Value must be %gt;= Min Seqs for Conserved Pos and &lt;= N, where N=number of sequences.
    max_pos_contig_nonconserved:
        ui-name : |
            Max Num Non-Conserved Pos
        short-hint : |
            The maximum number of non-conserved positions (columns) that may be included in a block; 8=default.  Value must be >= 0 and <= number of aligned positions (32000 upper bound).
    min_block_len:
        ui-name : |
            Min Block Len
        short-hint : |
            The minimum number of positions (columns) required to include a block in the output MSA (default is 10). Value must be >= 2 and <= number of aligned positions (32000 upper bound).
    remove_mask_positions_flag:
        ui-name : |
            Remove Masked Pos?
        short-hint : |
            If the first row of the MSA has "X" masking characters, remove those positions (columns) from output MSA. This is usually used for hypervariable regions (e.g. 16S). Note that the default is OFF.

    <p>This App uses Gblocks trims a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) to remove poorly aligned or highly divergent regions, revealing the better aligned regions that may be more reliable for estimation of evolutionary rates, such as for phylogeny reconstruction.

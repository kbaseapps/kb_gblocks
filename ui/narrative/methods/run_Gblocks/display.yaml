            Min Seqs for Conserved Pos
        short-hint : |
            Minimum number of sequences required with a conserved residue before a position (column) is considered a "Conserved Position"; 0=Use MSA-derived default (e.g. for 14 seqs, default is 8)
    min_seqs_for_flank:
        ui-name : |
            Min Seqs for Flank Pos
        short-hint : |
            Minimum number of sequences required with a residue in a position (column) flanking a conserved position before being considered a "Flank Position"; 0=Use MSA-derived default (e.g. for 14 seqs, default is 11)
    max_pos_contig_nonconserved:
        ui-name : |
            Max Num Non-Conserved Pos
        short-hint : |

            Min Block Len
        short-hint : |

        ui-name : |
            Remove Masked Pos?
        short-hint : |
            If first row of MSA has "X" masking characters, remove those positions (columns) from output MSA; Usually used for hypervariable regions (e.g. 16S); OFF=default.

    <p>This method trims Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) to capture the conserved blocks that may be more reliable regions from which to compare evolutionary rates, such as for tree building.  It uses the method Gblocks.</p>

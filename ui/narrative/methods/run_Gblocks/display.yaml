        long-hint : |
            Minimum number of sequences required with a conserved residue before a position (column) is considered a "Conserved Position". 0=Use MSA-derived default (e.g. for 14 seqs, default is 8).  Value must be &gt;= than N/2+1 and &lt;= Min Seqs For Flank Pos, where N=number of sequences.
    min_seqs_for_flank:
        ui-name : |

        long-hint : |
            Minimum number of sequences required with a residue in a position (column) flanking a conserved position before being considered a "Flank Position". 0=Use MSA-derived default (e.g. for 14 seqs, default is 11).

    <p>This method trims Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) to capture the conserved blocks that may be more reliable regions from which to compare evolutionary rates, such as for tree building.  It uses the method Gblocks.</p>
